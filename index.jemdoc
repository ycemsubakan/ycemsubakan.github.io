I obtained my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from [http://www.ee.boun.edu.tr Bogazici University EE department], respectively in 2011 and 2013. In Bogazici, I worked with [http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cemgil/index.html A. Taylan Cemgil] and [http://www.busim.ee.boun.edu.tr/~sankur/ Bulent Sankur]. I got my PhD from [http://www.cs.illinois.edu Computer Science Department] of [http://www.illinois.edu University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]. My PhD advisor was [http://paris.cs.illinois.edu/ Paris Smaragdis]. In Mila, I did a postdoc with [http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~lcharlin/ Laurent Charlin]. I am one of the core contributors to the [https://speechbrain.github.io/ Speechbrain] project. You can see my google scholar [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zXzV-0UAAAAJ&hl=en here].
